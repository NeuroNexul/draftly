# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Usage

1. **Create a changeset** when you make changes:

   ```bash
   bun run changeset
   ```

2. **Version packages** before release:

   ```bash
   bun run version-packages
   ```

3. **Publish to npm**:
   ```bash
   bun run release
   ```
